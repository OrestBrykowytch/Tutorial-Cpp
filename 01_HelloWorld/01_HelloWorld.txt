In this lesson, you learn how to make the system output "Hello World!".
This is the beginning for every language you learn, almost like a ritual.

In the .h file, there are 2 headers (#pragma once, #include <iostream>)
and there is a function declaration (void sayHelloWorld();)
I will explain more about the exact bits in a later lesson, but try to recognize some of the parts of the function,
and the #include header.

Headers:
#pragma once:
Prevents issues with header file names and other small things that may cause bugs

#include <iostream>:
Includes the iostream (In/Out Stream) library into the file.

Function Declaration:
functionType functionName(functionParameterType functionParameterName);
void sayHelloWorld(/*No parameters in this function*/);


In the .cpp file, there is a header (#include "01_HelloWorld.h")
and a function defenition
(
    void sayHelloWorld()
    {
        std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
    }
)

Header:
#include "01_HelloWorld.h":
Includes the 01_HelloWorld.h file into the file.

Function Defenition:
void sayHelloWorld()
{
    std::cout << "Hello World!" << std::endl;
}
We state the function we are defining, open the body, put the code inside. The code calls the std::cout function,
which opens a stream to the terminal, and shows whatever follows the << operator. after the second << operator,
the function std::endl is called, which makes a new line in the stream, which we then close with a semicolon.

If we were to include and call this function in main.cpp, compile and run it, the result would be 
Hello World!
in the terminal.
