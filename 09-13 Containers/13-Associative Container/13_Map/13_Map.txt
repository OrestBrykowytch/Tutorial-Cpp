Maps are containers that hold elements in a key-value combination, following a specific order. In a map, the key values are
generally used to sort and uniquely identify the elements, while the mapped values store the content associated to this key.
The unique keys are all sorted using a comparison function which can be overwritten by the programmer. The types of key and
mapped value may differ, and are grouped together in member type value_type, which is a pair type combining both:

typedef pair<const Key, T> value_type;


Internally, the elements in a map are always sorted by its key following a specific strict weak ordering criterion indicated by its
internal comparison object (of type Compare). Map containers are generally slower than unordered_map containers to access individual
elements by their key, but they allow the direct iteration on subsets based on their order. The mapped values in a map can be accessed
directly by their corresponding key using the bracket operator ((operator[]).

Maps are typically implemented as binary search trees, also known as red-black tree diagrams.

To construct a map object, there are a couple things you could do. In my header file (13_Map.h), you will see, there is no output of
the function representing these methods. Maps are typically initialized empty, and added onto later, but can have elements inserted 
at contruction. I just prefer to use the first way. Here's the five ways I managed to come up with:

1. std::map<type1, type2> mapName;
2. std::map<type1, type2> mapName (copyMapBeginIteration, copyMapEndIteration);
3. std::map<type1, type2> mapName (copyMap);
4. std::map<type1, type2, comparisonFunction> mapName;
5. std::map<type1, type2, comparisonFunctionPointer> mapName;

All together, there are 27 member functions.

1. std::map::at();

This is the accessor method for maps. It is used to return a reference to the mapped value that has the key input in the parameters.
This function commonly throws errors, so make sure your keys are typed out correctly, case-sensitively. If a key that does not exist
is put into the function parameter list, the function throws the out_of_range exception. This can return a const mapped_type reference
if the map itself is const-qualified. This is a C++11 function, so make sure to compile as C++11 or higher if you are using this. Format:

mapName.at(key);


2. std::map::begin();

Returns an iterator (or const_iterator) that refers to the first element in the map according to the map object's sorting function.
The function takes to parameters. Format:

mapName.begin();


3. std::map::cbegin();

Const version of begin(). Takes no parameters. C++11 function. Format:

mapName.cbegin();


4. std::map::cend();

Const version of end(). Takes no parameters. C++11 function. Format:

mapName.cend();


5. std::map::clear();

Clears and destroys all element keys and values from the map object, effectively clearing up memory. The size of the map becomes 0.
Takes no parameters. Format:

mapName.clear();


6. std::map::count();

This is a very interesting and useful member function of map. Basically, it goes through the entire map, and returns a boolean-like value
based on what exists in the map object. It takes one parameter, being the key you are searching for. If it finds a key that equals your key
input parameter, the function returns an unsigned_int value of 1, otherwise, it returns an unsigned_int value of 0. This is basically just a
boolean, but in integer form. Format:

mapName.count(keyValue);


7. std::map::crbegin();

This is the function that returns a const_reverse_iterator that points to the reverse beginning (the end) of the map object. If you really want
to mess with your head, keep in mind that this is a bidirectional iterator, meaning back and front is both sides simultaneously. How's that for 
brain food? Takes no parameters. This is a C++11 function. Format:

mapName.crbegin();


8. std::map::crend();

This is the end version of the const_reverse_iterator pointer member functions. It points at the reverse end (pre-first) element in the map object.
This is a C++11 function, and takes no parameters. Format:

mapName.crend();


9. std::map::emplace();

This is a very important member function in this header, and has to be used very carefully if you do not want weird results to happen. If the new
key that is being emplaced into the map already exists, the new element will not be added, and nothing happens, the program keeps on working. This 
is a C++11 function. It takes 2 parameters, the key and the mapped value. Format:

mapName.emplace(key, value);


10. std::map::emplace_hint();

This function is very similar to emplace(), but has an extension, the _hint() part. Even though the map will still sort the element in using its own 
comparison function, this helps the object speed up the process. It is like the "guess" function on a graphing calculator when evaluating equations.
The function returns an iterator to the newly mapped element, if the insertion is successful, otherwise, nothing is returned. The function takes 3
parameters, key, value, and location. Watch the ordering carefully. This is a C++11 function. Format:

mapName.emplace_hint(location, key, value);


11. std::map::empty();

This function returns a boolean (1 - True, or 0 - False) based on whether the map object is empty or not. Takes no parameters. Format:

mapName.empty();


12. std::map::end();

This is the function that returns a pointer to the theoretical post-end element. It takes no parameters. Format:

mapName.end();


13. std::map::equal_range();

This function returns the bounds of a range that includes all the elements in the container which have a key equivalent to "key", a parameter in the
paramlist. Since the elements in a map all have unique keys, the range returned will contain a single element at most. If no matches are found, the
range returned has a length of zero, with both iterators pointing to the first element that has a key considered to go after "key" according to the
container's internal comparison object or function (key_comp). Two keys are considered equivalent if the container's comparison object returns false
reflexively (i.e., no matter the order in which the keys are passed as arguments). This function takes one parameter, key. Format:

mapName.equal_range(key);


14. std::map::erase();

This function deletes the element specified in the parameter list with variable "element", "element begin" and "element end" to erase a range of them.
Formats:

mapName.erase(key/element);
mapName.erase(firstElement, lastElement);


15. std::map::find();

This function returns an iterator pointing at the found element in a map object. The element is found based on its key that is passed in via parameter list.
Takes one parameter, the key. Format:

mapName.find(key);


16. std::map::get_allocator();

This version of get_allocator() has 5 different functions in itself. The first 4, we know, and the last one is familiar. It is used very differently in
the <map> header. It is typically used to associate an allocator_type with a variable for cross-checking the specific types of varTypes in the map itself.
Formats:

mapName.get_allocator().allocate(amountToAllocate);
mapName.get_allocator().construct(where, value);
mapName.get_allocator().destroy(elementNumber);
mapName.get_allocator().deallocate(pointVar, amount);
mapName.get_allocator();


17. std::map::insert();

This function just inserts an element with Key and Value into the location requested. Can also be a list of elements. The element to be inserted must be in
pair form (std::pair<varType, varType>) with the varTypes that correspond to both the map and the element. Formats:

mapName.insert(std::pair<varType, varType>(key, value));
mapName.insert(rangeOfPairs);


18. std::map::key_comp();

This function returns a copy of the key_comparison object that is used by the map object. Takes no paramters. Format:

mapName.key_comp();


19. std::map::lower_bound();

This function returns the lower_bound of the key passed in the paramList. Lower_bound is an iterator to the the first element in the container whose key
is not considered to go before "key". Takes only one parameter, key. Format:

mapName.lower_bound(key);


20. std::map::max_size();

Like all other max_size functions, it returns an unsigned_int value of the amount of elements the map could theoretically store. Takes no parameters. Format:

mapName.max_size();


21. std::map::operator=;

This is just the normal assignment operator. Assigns elements to a map by copying them. Is incapable of taking parameters. Format:

mapName = mapName2;


22. std::map::operator[];

This is the access element function that works like in every other header file. If you input a key whose value exists, it will return the value of that element, 
otherwise, the map will create a new element with given key, but no mapped value. This function takes one parameter, the key. By the way, here is a fun way of screwing
around with code, if you want to use this function without using [], but also taking much longer to write it out: 
(*((this->insert(make_pair(k,mapped_type()))).first)).second
Format:

mapName[key];


23. std::map::rbegin();

This is the reverse version of the begin function, returning an iterator that points to the last element in the map. Takes no parameters. Format:

mapName.rbegin();


24. std::map::rend();

This is the reverse version of the end function, returning an iterator that points to the theoretical before-first element in the map. Takes no parameters. Format:

mapName.rend();


25. std::map::size();

This function returns the current size value in a unsigned_int form. Takes no parameters. Format:

mapName.size();


26. std::map::swap();

This function exchanges the contents of 2 maps between each other, as long as they are compatible with each other. Takes one parameter. Format:

mapName1.swap(mapName2);


27. std::map::upper_bound();

This function returns a pointer to the first element in the map that is considered to go after "key". It is like lower_bound, but the other way. Takes one parameter, key.
Format:

mapName.upper_bound(key);
